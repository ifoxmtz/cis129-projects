print("Once upon a time, in a world far away, lived a little puppy.")
print("The puppy loved to roam outside amongst the foliage and fauna.")
print("One day, the puppy stumbled upon a steaming hot pile of tacos.")
print("She loved the smell of spiced meat and aromatic salsa and proceeded to gobble it up.")
print("Content with a full belly, the puppy found a spot of sunlight to snooze the rest of the day away.")
