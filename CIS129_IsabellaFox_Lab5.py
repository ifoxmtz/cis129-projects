# Lab 5 The Bottle Return Program

# Step 1: Declare variables below 
total_bottles = 0 # store the accumulated bottle values
counter = 1 # control the loop
today_bottles = 0 # store the number of bottles returned on a day
total_payout = 0 # store the calculated value of totalBottles times .10
keep_going = "y" # used to run the program again

# Step 2: Loop to run program again
while keep_going == "y":
    # Step 3: Code to set value of variables
    DAYS = 7
    total_bottles = 0 # store the accumulated bottle values
    counter = 1 # control the loop
    today_bottles = 0 # store the number of bottles returned on a day
    total_payout = 0    
    while counter <= DAYS:
